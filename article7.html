            <p>Knot tying is an essential survival skill. It allows you to create secure shelters, fishing lines, traps, and more. Here are some fundamental knots you should learn:</p>
            <h2>The Square Knot</h2>
            <p>The square knot, also known as the reef knot, is used to join two ropes of equal diameter. It's simple and effective for binding bundles and securing items.</p>
            <h2>The Bowline Knot</h2>
            <p>The bowline knot creates a secure loop at the end of a rope. It's easy to tie and untie, making it useful for rescue operations and securing lines.</p>
            <h2>The Clove Hitch</h2>
            <p>The clove hitch is used to secure a rope to a post or tree. It's quick to tie and holds well under tension, making it ideal for setting up shelters or securing gear.</p>
            <h2>The Figure Eight Knot</h2>
            <p>The figure eight knot creates a strong, secure stopper at the end of a rope. It's commonly used in climbing and rescue operations to prevent the rope from slipping through devices.</p>
            <h2>The Taut-Line Hitch</h2>
            <p>The taut-line hitch is an adjustable knot used for tensioning lines, such as tent guy lines. It slides easily but holds firm under tension.</p>
            <p>Practice these knots regularly to build muscle memory. Knot tying is a valuable skill that can enhance your ability to survive and thrive in the wilderness.</p>
