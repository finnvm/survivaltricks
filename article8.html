            <p>Knowing how to signal for help is crucial in survival situations. Effective signaling can attract the attention of rescuers and increase your chances of being found. Here are some methods for signaling for help:</p>
            <h2>Use a Signal Mirror</h2>
            <p>A signal mirror is a highly effective tool for attracting attention. Use the mirror to reflect sunlight toward potential rescuers. Aim the reflection at aircraft, boats, or distant people.</p>
            <h2>Build a Signal Fire</h2>
            <p>Build a large, smoky fire to signal for help. Use green branches, leaves, or grass to create thick smoke. Create three fires in a triangular formation, as this is a recognized distress signal.</p>
            <h2>Use Whistles or Shouts</h2>
            <p>Carry a whistle as part of your survival gear. Three short blasts on a whistle is a standard distress signal. If you don't have a whistle, use loud, repeated shouts to attract attention.</p>
            <h2>Create Ground Signals</h2>
            <p>Use rocks, logs, or other natural materials to create large, visible ground signals. Common signals include SOS, large arrows pointing to your location, or a large X to indicate distress.</p>
            <h2>Use Flashlights or Strobes</h2>
            <p>At night, use a flashlight or strobe light to signal for help. Flashing your light in groups of three is a recognized distress signal. Move the light side to side to increase visibility.</p>
            <p>By mastering these signaling techniques, you can improve your chances of being found and rescued in an emergency situation. Always be prepared and stay calm while signaling for help.</p>
